> Although I don't think Bitcoin is now suitable for small payments, it will eventually become a reality as storage space and bandwidth costs continue to fall.

> If bitcoin is popular on a large scale, then by that time micropayments have become popular.

> Another way to make them more useful is if I implement a client-only model and the number of network nodes merges into a smaller number of professional server farms. No matter how large a small amount of payment you need, it will eventually be feasible. I think bandwidth and storage will be negligible in 5 to 10 years.

**``2016-05-05``** CSW's blog post ["Paul Sartre, Signature and Meaning"] (https://web.archive.org/web/20160505135432/http://www.drcraigwright .net/jean-paul-sartre-signing-significance/) Content update:

> I believe I can do it. I believe that I can leave behind the days of incognito. However, with the development of this week's events, and my readiness to publish proof of the earliest private key, I collapsed. I am weak. I can not.

> At the beginning of the rumor, I was attacked by many parties. When these allegations proved to be false, new allegations have begun. I now know that I am not strong enough to bear all of this.

> I know this weakness can do a lot of damage to those who support me, especially for Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen. I can only hope that their honor and credibility will not be irreparably damaged by my actions. They have not been deceived, but I know that the world will never believe this now. I can only say sorry.

> Goodbye.

**``2017-05-04``** Ian Grigg on the blog [post] (http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001617.html)

- Nakamoto's private key was moved to a safe place very early (around 2009, I am not sure, I am not there) because the original is in danger. After that, the key was moved to another place again (probably 2013). Finally, they were transferred again.
- Re-emphasize that Satoshi Nakamoto is a team: it is not a person: it is a team, and it is deliberate, cautious, and carefully set.

- Why is the total amount of Bitcoin 2100w? CSW: “Reference to the global M1 total of 2100 trillion US dollars, M1 is a narrow money supply”

- Can Bitcoin resist quantum attacks? CSW: "Bitcoin uses a double hash algorithm, the unused address is very secure. So only use the address once. And using quantum computers to attack bitcoin is costly."
